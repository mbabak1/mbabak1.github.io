        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Murtaza Babak, I work as a student worker at International Studies Office located in Arts and Science hall.
I love to play video game and soccer I also enjoy going to the gym and watching movies. Each year I try to learn something new during summer.
Last year me and a group of friends learned how to long board.</p>

        <p>I went to Elkhorn South High School and graduated on May of 2016. After finishing high school I started attending UNO. My major is
Management Information Systems (MIS). I wanted to learn about computers and technology from a very young age. The first
ever computer that I used was the Pentium 1 by Microsoft and I was fascinated with it from the very beginning.

</p>

        <p>In my free time I usually try to go workout or go play cards with my friends. Watching movies and playing games are also
my hobbies. I often like to watch action and comedy movies. I also love to watch stand-up comedy. My favorite comedians
are Kevin Hart and Bull Burr.
